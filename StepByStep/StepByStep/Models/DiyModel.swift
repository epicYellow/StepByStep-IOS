This horizontal slat fence features tall, wood stained fence panels, gorgeous planters, and string lights.

(This is what we did.)", "If you are beginning a completely new project you will need to set the posts in the ground at least 12” deep (which will make the final fence shorter than ours). Use a post-hole digger to make a hole 8 inches wide and just over 2-feet deep. Pour about 4 inches of gravel for the base, and then insert the 8-foot 4×4 post into the hole. Then pour fast-drying concrete mix into the hole surrounding the post. Use a three-way level to make sure the post is standing straight. Tamp down the dry concrete. This draws natural moisture from the ground to harden or “set” the packed concrete around the post.For this option, you will need to let the posts set overnight before continuing the project.", "INSTALL THE SLATS", "Once posts are set, begin attaching the 1″ x 6″ x 8’ planks beginning at the top of the fence, to make sure it stays flush.

Make the holes about 12 inches in diameter, giving you enough room to get a spade down into, yet at the same time keeping it small enough to ensure a snug and secure base for the posts.","After digging the post holes for the wire trellis, place about an inch of crushed gravel in the bottom of the hole with a flat rock on top.

See more at: https://www.goodshomedesign.com/build-fire-pit/", category: "Fireplace Hacks", author: " GoodsHomeDesign", steps: ["The first thing you have to do is decide on the size of your pit and then use a string, cut to the length of the radius of your future `circle of fire`, in order to have a close to perfect measurement. Place one end (wrapped around a stake) in the center of the location of the pit and the other end tied to a can of marking paint, and start drawing a circle with it. With your pit all marked, take the shovel and dig out a 12-inch deep hole. Then, make a sturdy base by spreading a 4-inch layer of gravel or lava rocks. Rake the top layer flat and continue on to placing the bricks or retaining wall units secured into the base with a mallet. Use the shovel again, but this time to remove sod away from the rim of your pit. This is necessary because you must place flat rocks all around the pit, in a circle. Make sure they sit partially on the bricks and the spaces between are filled with dirt. Done! The fire pit looks professionally and you made it with your own hands in a matter of hours.
